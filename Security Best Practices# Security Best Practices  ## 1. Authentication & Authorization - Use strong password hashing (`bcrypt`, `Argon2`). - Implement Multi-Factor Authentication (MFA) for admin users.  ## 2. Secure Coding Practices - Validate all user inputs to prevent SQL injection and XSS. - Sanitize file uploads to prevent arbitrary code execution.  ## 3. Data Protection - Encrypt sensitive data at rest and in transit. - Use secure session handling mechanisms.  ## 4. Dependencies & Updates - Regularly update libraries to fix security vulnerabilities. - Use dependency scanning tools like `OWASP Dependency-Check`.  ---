# Security Best Practices

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong password hashing (`bcrypt`, `Argon2`).
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin users.

## 2. Secure Coding Practices
- Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
- Sanitize file uploads to prevent arbitrary code execution.

## 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Use secure session handling mechanisms.

## 4. Dependencies & Updates
- Regularly update libraries to fix security vulnerabilities.
- Use dependency scanning tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check`.

## No passowrds should be hard coded
