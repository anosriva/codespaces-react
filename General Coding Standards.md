# General Coding Standards

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the general coding standards that all developers must follow to ensure maintainability, readability, and consistency across projects.

## 2. Code Formatting
- Use spaces instead of tabs (4 spaces per indentation level).
- Keep line lengths under 100 characters.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes).

## 3. Comments & Documentation
- Use comments to explain the **why**, not the **what**.
- Document all public functions with proper docstrings.
- Use inline comments sparingly and only when necessary.

## 4. Code Structure
- Separate logic into modular functions.
- Avoid deeply nested conditions.
- Use descriptive filenames and organize code in a structured directory format.

## 5. Version Control
- Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.
- Follow the branch naming convention: `feature/branch-name`, `bugfix/branch-name`, `hotfix/branch-name`.

## 6. Security Best Practices
- Never hardcode sensitive information (use environment variables).
- Validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Use proper error handling to avoid exposing stack traces.
